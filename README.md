# React vs. Blazor

This demo shows how React apps can live together with Blazor apps, which are basically C# apps running in the browser with the help of WebAssembly.

## Getting started

To configure Blazor on your machine, you can follow the [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/get-started) online. For the rest, you only need:

```
npm install
```

### Build

To build the project and run it locally, run

```
npm run build
npm start
```

The later will create a web site at `http://localhost:8080/react-blazor/`.
